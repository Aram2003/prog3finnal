Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it. Even though the gameplay is largely the same as in the previous GTA, it's still a lot of fun. Gamers itchin' for a monster-truck fix should save their cash until the real thing rolls into town. If you're armed with weapons and a strong disrespect for authority, you might just want to take that Body Count song to heart and become a cop killer. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic tale of life in Americaâ€™s unforgiving heartland. Agent will take you on a paranoid journey into the world of counterintelligence, espionage, and political assassinations during the height of the Cold War at the end of the 1970s. Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it. Even though the gameplay is largely the same as in the previous GTA, it's still a lot of fun. Evel Knievel is all about precision - knowing when to tap what, how hard, and for how long is integral to making an enjoyable experience out of this game. If you're armed with weapons and a strong disrespect for authority, you might just want to take that Body Count song to heart and become a cop killer. Midnight Club: Street Racing takes the basic concepts and modes that made Midtown Madness so much fun and adds to it more hidden vehicles and a rudimentary plotline. Gamers itchin' for a monster-truck fix should save their cash until the real thing rolls into town. If you're finished with Tony Hawk, and you're hungry for another challenge, Thrasher: Skate and Destroy is the meal you're looking for. If it weren't for the terrible control scheme, horribly accurate AI, and confusing terrain, this game would still be overly simple. If you can't play this intense, original action game on any platform except the PS2, then that's where you should play it--but only by default. The basic rule is drive fast and furious, and most of all, don't get caught. The whole thing feels like it was slapped together in a supreme hurry to cash in on the release of the film. Oni features fluid, dynamic animation, some exciting combat sequences, and a fairly involving story that links everything together. However, it suffers from a few very noticeable problems. The surfing game genre may be sparse, but there are still several surfing games that are more worth your time than Surfing H3O. After a long hiatus, 2K Games is bringing Duke back for gamers to enjoy Duke Nukem Forever. Grand Theft Auto III is, quite simply, an incredible experience that shouldn't be missed by anyone mature enough to handle it. Get both GTA III and GTA: Vice City in this compilation pack for the PS2. The best part about State of Emergency is the way every facet of the game comes together to form a perfect feeling of panic. Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory will instantly endear itself to fans of the original, as it is essentially a better-looking and more fun version of the original. It's a great introduction for first-time smugglers, but those already familiar with the series won't find much new here. Rockstar's Western-themed shooter has some great style and enough fun moments to justify the rough edges. Midnight Club II is just as solid as the original Midnight Club was in its day, and it features a handful of improvements. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City provides just about everything you'd want in a follow-up to an outstanding game. Max Payne 2 is just a remarkable production, and what it lacks in length or volume it more than makes up for in quality and density."
